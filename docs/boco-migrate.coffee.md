## Installation

Installation is available via [npm] or [github].

```bash
$ npm install boco-migrate
$ git clone https://github.com/bocodigitalmedia/boco-migrate
```

## Usage

```coffee
BocoMigrate = require "boco-migrate"
lastMigration = null

# Create a migrator
migrator = new BocoMigrate.Migrator
  storageAdapter: new BocoMigrate.StorageAdapter

# Add migrations, in order
migrator.addMigration
  id: "migration1"
  up: (done) -> lastMigration = @id; done()
  down: (done) -> lastMigration = null; done()

migrator.addMigration
  id: "migration2"
  up: (done) -> lastMigration = @id; done()
  down: (done) -> lastMigration = "migration1"; done()

migrator.addMigration
  id: "migration3"
  up: (done) -> lastMigration = @id; done()
  down: (done) -> lastMigration = "migration2"; done()
```

### Migrating

passing `null` or `undefined` runs all pending migrations.

```coffee
migrator.migrate null, (error) ->
  throw error if error?
  expect(lastMigration).toEqual "migration3"
  ok()
```

passing a target `migrationId` migrates to the state of that migration.

```coffee
migrator.migrate "migration1", (error) ->
  throw error if error?
  expect(lastMigration).toEqual "migration1"
  ok()
```

### Rolling Back

`rollback` rolls back the latest migration.

```coffee
migrator.migrate null, (error) ->
  throw error if error?

  migrator.rollback (error) ->
    throw error if error?
    expect(lastMigration).toEqual "migration2"
    ok()
```

### Resetting

`reset` rolls back all migrations.

```coffee
migrator.migrate null, (error) ->
  throw error if error?

  migrator.reset (error) ->
    throw error if error?
    expect(lastMigration).toEqual null
    ok()
```

### Irreversible Migrations

A migration that has not defined a `down` method will raise an `IrreversibleMigration` error.

```coffee
migrator.addMigration
  id: "migration4"
  up: (done) -> lastMigration = @id; done()
```

A migration that has not defined a `down` method will raise an `IrreversibleMigration` error.

```coffee
migrator.migrate null, (error) ->
  throw error if error?
  migrator.rollback (error) ->
    expect(error.constructor).toEqual BocoMigrate.IrreversibleMigration
    ok()
```

## Using the CLI

A CLI is provided with this package to allow you to run your migrations from the command line.

```text
Usage: boco-migrate <options...> <command>

options:
  -h, --help                   show this help screen
  -e, --example                show an example migrator factory
  -f, --factory=factory_path   path to the migrator factory
                               defaults to "migratorFactory.js"

commands:
  migrate
    Migrate to the (optional) target migration id
  rollback
    Roll back the latest migration
  reset
    Roll back all migrations
  info
    Show migration information

factory:
  A javascript file that exports a single async factory method,
  returning a migrator instance for the CLI.
```

### Creating a Migrator Factory

Your migrator factory file must export a single async function, and returns a `Migrator` instance. This allows you to connect to databases and perform other asynchronous tasks to initialize both the migrator as well as your migrations.

```js
// file: "migratorFactory.js"
var MyDBLib = require("my-db-lib");
var MyDBAdapter = require("my-db-adapter");
var MyDBMigrations = require("my-db-migrations");
var Migrator = require("boco-migrate").Migrator;

module.exports = function(done) {

  MyDBLib.connect(function(error, db) {
    var adapter = new MyDBAdapter({ db: db });
    var migrator = new Migrator({ adapter: adapter });
    var migrations = MyDBMigrations.configure({ db: db });

    migrations.forEach(function(migration) {
      migrator.addMigration(migration);
    });

    return done(null, migrator);
};
```

## Storage Adapters

In order for the migrator to persist its state, you must provide it with a storage adapter for the storage mechanism of your choice.

The default `StorageAdapter` is non-persistent, and primarily used for testing or as a parent class for extended adapters.

### Available Adapters

The `StorageAdapter` interface is currently in flux, and expected to be settled shortly in __v2.0__. Once the interface has been locked down, I will release a few options and list them here.
